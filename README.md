# sound-images

repository for exploring visual representations of sound in machine learning 

plan is to make engravings of processed MFCC spectrograms - which are used by Machine learning to classify sounds as a certain event/concept

the spectrograms will then be layers with wireframe/2D/digital impressions of the sounds scraped from the web
then I will take computational photographs of the engravings outside

The final images will also be sound reactive

experiment with slowing down the sounds
